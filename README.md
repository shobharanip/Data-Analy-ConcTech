Course Objectives

The core concepts of data analytics and machine learning and develop practical skills in using Python and its libraries for data analysis, model building, and applying critical algorithms like classification, regression, and clustering to real-world problems. They will also learn to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and efficiently implement machine learning workflows and pipelines.

Assessable Learning Outcomes:

• Master the basics of Python for machine learning, including data structures and libraries.
• Conduct exploratory data analysis using Python to uncover insights from data.
• Implement regression and classification models and evaluate their performance.
• Understand and apply techniques for feature engineering, model selection, and tuning.
• Work with unsupervised learning methods such as clustering and dimensionality reduction.
• Prepare for industry-recognized AI certification
